If person A's id is 'aaabbb' and person B's id is 'eeeeeee', you create a thread between them with a node 'aaabbbeeeeeee' and all their messages are stored at that node.
In this case, when loading conversations between the two, say in a list, you query just that endpoint. An example of setting user endpoint is shown below
Function setsup endpoint for one to one chat*/
